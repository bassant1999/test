<div class="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This is a reading website that enables users to read publicly listed
        books, purchase paid books through a link to external websites, and
        add their previous readings from other websites such as Goodreads.<br/>
        Our focus is to build a recommendation system for personalized search
        and recommendations.<br/>
        the website will recommend both publicly listed books that the user
        can read on the site, and other books through a link to external websites
        (e.g. Amazon).</p>
